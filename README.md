# Facial-Expressions-Recognition
Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is the technology that analyses facial expressions from both static images and videos in order to reveal information of oneâ€™s emotional state. The complexity of facial expressions, the potential use of the technology in any context, and the involvement of new technologies such as artificial intelligence raise significant privacy risks.
